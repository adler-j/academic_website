# Biography

I'm a Research Scientist at Elekta, pursuing a PhD in Applied Mathematics under the supervision of [Ozan Ã–ktem](https://www.kth.se/profile/ozan).

I do research in inverse problems and machine learning, especially focusing on the intersection between model-driven and data-driven methods.
